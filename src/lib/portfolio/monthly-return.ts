/**
 * Canonical monthly-return formula for the Hearst Yield Vault.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the period return of an LP-facing vault series.
 *
 * Three modules previously coexisted with subtly different formulas
 * (cf. `docs/audit/coherence-2026-05-26/10-portfolio-lp-metrics.md` § P0-2):
 *   - `src/lib/portfolio/returns.ts`        → NAV-only (TWR pur, biais à la baisse)
 *   - `src/lib/data/advanced-metrics.ts`    → NAV + distribution add-back (correct)
 *   - `src/lib/engine/lp-pnl.ts`            → simple annualisation linéaire
 *
 * The financially correct formula for a period return on an investable fund
 * series is the "modified Dietz / NAV + distribution add-back" form:
 *
 *     r_t = (nav_t - nav_{t-1} + dist_t) / nav_{t-1}
 *
 * Distributions paid out during the period are added to the ending NAV so the
 * return reflects the realised yield the LP got as cash *plus* the mark-to-market
 * move of the residual NAV. Without this add-back, every month with a paid
 * distribution looks artificially worse than it actually was.
 *
 * Purity: this function has no I/O, no `Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`.
 * It is safe to import from any layer (engine, server data loaders, client
 * components if needed). All callers must pass in their own observations.

   * Distributions paid OUT of the vault during the period (USDC). Positive
   * value. Defaults to 0 when the upstream series does not carry distribution
   * data — in that mode the formula degrades to a pure NAV ratio (TWR-only).
   *
   * NOTE: defaulting to 0 is acceptable for callers that genuinely have no
   * distribution series (e.g. `getVaultReturns` reading raw `VaultSnapshot`
   * rows that do not carry monthly distribution totals). Once a distribution
   * series is available those callers should pass it in.

 *
 * Edge cases:
 *  - `navStart <= 0`         → return 0 (cannot compute a meaningful ratio).
 *  - `navStart`/`navEnd` NaN → return 0.
 *  - Negative distribution   → clamped to 0 (a distribution is, by definition,
 *                              a positive outflow; negative values are caller
 *                              errors and must not flip the sign).
