 *   - v2.0 (Monte Carlo extension, 2026-05-22, ratified via ADR-006) — cited when
 *     the agent input is a Monte Carlo output (p5/p50/p95, paths, seed).
 *
 * The draft `v2.1-draft.md` (multi-vault + share classes, 2026-05-26) is NOT loaded
 * here: it is unratified, must not appear in any LP-facing output, and is intentionally
 * excluded from the `MethodologyVersion` literal type so a typo cannot leak it into
 * an agent prompt.
 *
 * We read the markdown at module-load (server side) so:
 *   1) The exact contents are embedded in the system prompt that we cache.
 *   2) Any drift between the doc and the prompt is impossible — they are the same bytes.
