/**
 * Centralised freshness logic for data loaders.
 *
 * Background: prior to this module each upstream loader redefined its own
 * `STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` constant (btc-price = 5min, hashprice = 10min,
 * fear-greed = 60min). The thresholds are *intentionally different per
 * source* — BTC price moves second-by-second, network difficulty barely
 * moves over a day — but the *evaluation* should live in one place so the
 * audit trail is unambiguous (cf. audit `docs/audit/coherence-2026-05-26/
 * 05-provenance-badges.md` §"Freshness centralisée").
 *
 * Convention:
 *   - `STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` is the **default** SLO (5 minutes) — sources
 *     without a specific need inherit this.
 *   - Sources that legitimately tolerate a longer freshness window
 *     (network difficulty, sentiment index) declare their own value via
 *     the `STALE_THRESHOLDS` registry below and read it back here.
 *   - `evaluateFreshness(asOf, threshold)` is the single decision point.
 *     A `null`/missing `asOf` is treated as stale (no data ⇒ no claim).
