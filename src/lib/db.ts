/**
 * Prisma 7 + Next.js dev singleton.
 *
 * Prisma 7 no longer ships a native query engine per platform — the client
 * runs against a **driver adapter** (`@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3` for
 * local dev / `@prisma/adapter-pg` on Vercel). The provider is env-driven
 * (`PRISMA_PROVIDER`) and mirrors `prisma.config.ts`, so the CLI and the
 * runtime stay in lockstep.
 *
 * Both adapter packages (and their native deps `better-sqlite3` / `pg`) are
 * listed in `next.config.ts#serverExternalPackages`, so importing both
 * statically here is free at bundle-time — only the branch actually used at
 * runtime instantiates a native driver.
 *
 * In development, Next.js HMR re-evaluates this module on every change,
 * which would otherwise spawn a new PrismaClient (and a new connection
 * pool) on each reload until the DB runs out of connections. We stash
 * the client on `globalThis` so it survives HMR. The `as unknown as`
 * cast is required because `globalThis` is typed as the global scope and
 * has no `prisma` member — there is no safer way to augment it inline.
 *
 * On Vercel serverless (PostgreSQL), the Pool is also memoised: without it,
 * each cold invocation would open a new pg connection and quickly saturate
 * Supabase's ~60-connection pool limit. `max: 1` + `idleTimeoutMillis` keeps
 * the footprint serverless-safe while still reusing the connection across
 * multiple requests within the same Lambda execution context.
