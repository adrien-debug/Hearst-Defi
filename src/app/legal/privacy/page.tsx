          The structure below reflects the data Hearst Connect actually
          processes (session, KYC, analytics, on-chain transactions). The legal
          language must be reviewed and finalized by qualified counsel before
          this page is exposed to live investors.

      <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account &amp; authentication</strong> — email address,
          password hash (argon2id), session identifier (opaque, httpOnly
          cookie), role.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>KYC / AML</strong> — identity documents, address, source of
          funds, sanctions screening results. Collected and stored only for
          accredited investor verification, retained per AML regulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-chain identifiers</strong> — wallet addresses linked to
          your account for subscriptions, distributions, and proof-of-reserves
          attestations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operational telemetry</strong> — request identifiers, hashed
          user identifiers (SHA-256), error reports (Sentry), product analytics
          (PostHog, no autocapture).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal bases</h2>
      <p>
        Contract performance (account, subscription), legal obligation (AML /

        prevention, product analytics).
      </p>

      <h2>4. Storage &amp; retention</h2>
      <p>
        Account and KYC data: retained for the legal minimum required by Cayman
        AML regulation after account closure. Session records: rolling 30 days,
        extended on activity. Operational logs: 90 days unless required longer
        for incident investigation.
