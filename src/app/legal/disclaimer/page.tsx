          The risk factors below reflect the actual architecture of the product
          (mining-backed yield, USDC distributions, Cayman SPV, custody
          provider, smart contracts on Base). The legal language must be
          reviewed and finalized by qualified counsel.

      <p>
        Hearst Yield Vault is an institutional RWA yield vault backed by Bitcoin
        mining cash flows. Principal is held in a USDC reserve (Model B) and is
        not deployed on-chain; the monthly USDC distribution is funded by a
        mining-revenue-share. Bitcoin price is an economic factor (it drives
        mining hashprice) and a small capped tactical sleeve — it is not the
        primary exposure. Investment involves substantial risk, including loss
        of principal. APY ranges are target projections based on disclosed
        assumptions; they are not guarantees, commitments, or predictions of
        future returns. Past performance does not predict future results.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Mining revenue risk (primary)</h2>
      <p>
        The vault's distribution is funded by Bitcoin mining cash flows. Mining
        revenue — and therefore distribution coverage — is sensitive to network
        hashprice, energy costs, network difficulty, fleet uptime, halving
        events, hardware availability, and regulatory action in mining
        jurisdictions. Adverse moves in any of these factors can reduce, defer,
        or eliminate distributions, independent of Bitcoin's spot price.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Smart contract risk</h2>
      <p>
        On-chain components (ERC-4626 vault, event logger, proof-of-reserves
        registry) are deployed on Base. Smart contracts may contain
        undiscovered vulnerabilities. Mainnet deployment of the vault is gated
        on completion of a third-party security audit (Spearbit) and
        remediation of any findings. Even after audit, residual risk remains.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Custody risk</h2>
      <p>
        Underlying assets are held with an institutional custody provider
        (Fireblocks). Proof-of-reserves attestations are published on a regular
        cadence. Custody failure, key compromise, or operational error at the
        custodian could result in loss.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Liquidity &amp; lock-up risk</h2>
      <p>
        Subscriptions carry a 60-day soft lock-up. Withdrawals are processed at
        scheduled valuation points and may be deferred or gated in exceptional
        liquidity events. You should not subscribe with funds you may need on
        short notice.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Regulatory &amp; jurisdiction risk</h2>
      <p>
        The SPV is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Regulatory frameworks
        applicable to digital assets, Bitcoin mining, and RWA / mining-backed
        structured products continue to evolve. Changes in law or enforcement could materially
        affect the product or your ability to participate.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Stablecoin &amp; redemption risk</h2>
      <p>
        Distributions and redemptions are settled in USDC. USDC is a
        third-party issued stablecoin; its peg, redemption rights, and
        compliance posture are outside Hearst's control.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Operational &amp; counterparty risk</h2>
      <p>
        The product depends on third-party infrastructure (custody, hosting,
        oracles, KYC processors). Operational failure at any counterparty could
        affect product availability, distributions, or attestations.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Tax</h2>
      <p>
        Tax treatment depends on your jurisdiction and personal circumstances.
        Hearst does not provide tax advice. Consult your own advisor.
      </p>

      <h2>9. No guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing in the product communicates a guarantee, promise, or
        risk-free return. The APY range is an estimate. Distributions are not
        guaranteed. Capital is at risk.
