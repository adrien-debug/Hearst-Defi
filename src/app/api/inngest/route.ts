/**
 * Inngest webhook endpoint.
 *
 * Inngest invokes this URL to discover registered functions and execute
 * individual steps. Cron triggers are scheduled by the Inngest platform
 * and dispatched here.
 *
 * Registered functions:
 *   - market-data-hourly  (every hour)
 *   - mining-health-daily (08:00 UTC daily)
 *   - investor-memo-monthly (1st of month 09:00 UTC)
 *
 * Security — request signature verification (P0):
 *
 * Every GET/POST/PUT here is signature-verified by `serve()` BEFORE any
 * function or step runs. inngest@4's `InngestCommHandler` runs request
 * signature validation unconditionally: `skipSignatureValidation`
 * defaults to `false` (InngestCommHandler.js:193) and is never enabled
 * by this route, so it always rejects a missing/invalid
 * `X-Inngest-Signature` header — and throws if no signing key is
 * available — before dispatching anything.
 *
 * The signing key is sourced by the `Inngest` client (see
 * `@/lib/inngest/client`) from the `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` env var. In
 * inngest@4 `signingKey` is a `ClientOptions` field (constructor-level),
 * NOT a `serve()` option, so it is intentionally not duplicated here.
 *
 * Defense in depth: `src/lib/env.ts` validates `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`
 * with Zod and HARD-FAILS at server boot in production if it is absent
 * (see the `IS_RUNTIME_PRODUCTION` guard). The reference below makes
 * that contract explicit and load-bearing for this endpoint: this route
 * can never run unauthenticated in production.
